I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Dr. Youtao Zhang](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~zhangyt/) and [Dr. Xulong Tang](https://xzt102.github.io/).  I received my M.S. in Telecommunications from the University of Maryland and my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Beihang University, China.

My research interests center on machine learning systems and accelerators, with a focus on efficient systems and robust algorithms for deep graph learning. Specifically, I work on accelerating Graph Neural Network-based deep graph learning models across diverse platforms and exploring the robustness of these applications against adversarial attacks.

<p style="color: MediumSeaGreen; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
  ðŸŒŸ I am actively seeking tenure-track faculty positions and research scientist positions in industry. Please kindly reach out to me regarding any potential opportunities.
