I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by [Dr. Youtao Zhang](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~zhangyt/) and [Dr. Xulong Tang](https://xzt102.github.io/).  I received my M.S. in Telecommunications from the University of Maryland and my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Beihang University in China.

My research focuses on machine learning systems & accelerators, with a particular emphasis on advancing deep graph learning techniques. I explore how to efficiently and securely deploy graph neural networks (GNNs) across diverse platforms, addressing the challenges of their scalability, efficiency, and robustness in both inference and training.

<p style="color: MediumSeaGreen; font-style: italic;">
  I am actively seeking tenure-track faculty positions and research scientist positions in industry. Please kindly reach out to me regarding any potential opportunities.
