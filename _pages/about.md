I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh under the guidance of [Dr. Youtao Zhang](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~zhangyt/) and [Dr. Xulong Tang](https://xzt102.github.io/). I received my M.S. in Telecommunications from the University of Maryland and my B.E. in Electrical Engineering from Beihang University, China.

My research centers on **efficient, trustworthy computing systems for advanced graph-learning workloads.** I accelerate Graph Neural Networks across heterogeneous hardwareâ€”from edge devices to multi-GPU clustersâ€”while safeguarding them against adaptive adversarial attacks. Looking ahead, I aim to design **scalable, secure infrastructure for complex graph learning applications**, including real-time dynamic-graph learning and low-latency agent-based systems. In parallel, I am developing full-stack co-designs of software and hardware that deliver efficiency and robustness to graph-aware AI algorithms, such as graph-augmented retrieval-and-generation (GraphRAG) and other GNN Ã— LLM hybrids.

  ðŸŒŸ I am recruiting self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my group in Spring/Fallâ€¯2026.
